          Live graphs show your poll results immediately in easy to an easy to understand format. 
          One graph will not provide the whole picture, that's why we provide multiple graph types 
          to better describe your results.

          Traditional desktop computers now represent only 30% of Internet traffic. Your poll 
          must work on the tablets, smart phones, netbooks and notebooks that your visitors are using. 
          Our responsive designs do just that.
        </app-feature>
        <app-feature class="feature-social" icon="fa-group" title="Social Integration">
          Free integrated facebook or traditional comments allow your poll voters to provide 
          immediate feedback and discuss results. Social share buttons encourage your poll 
          voters to help spread the word.
